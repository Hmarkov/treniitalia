# TreniItalia

**Under Development**

TreniItalia is a React Native application designed to streamline the process of monitoring train stations across Italy.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind developing TreniItalia stems from personal experiences of frustration while trying to check train schedules, particularly in stations like ROME TERMINI. My family, frequent travelers within Italy, often encountered difficulties, especially for my tech-savvy grandmother, who struggles with accessing distant monitors. This challenge prompted the development of an app to simplify the process for travelers like her.

## Features

- Provides access to current train schedules across Italy.
- Utilizes data from [Rete Ferroviaria Italiana](https://www.rfi.it/en/stations/station-page/quality-services/Public-information/Live-departures-Arrivals-Monitor.html), serving as the primary scraping source.
- Utilizes AWS Lambda Functions and AWS API Gateway to maintain a live API endpoint, ensuring separation between the backend and frontend.
